# NOTE!!!

Just want you guys to read more about this, this repository is only for educational purposes. Just to make sure about something...

1. I won't be responsible on whatever the hell that happened to your account (example: suspended/terminated) as it's beyond my control on what I can do to limit you guys from doing anything.

2. Just to be sure, kindly don't use this for any other purposes such as hacking, scamming, phishing, mining. Again, I'm not the one at fault if your account got suspended/terminated.
